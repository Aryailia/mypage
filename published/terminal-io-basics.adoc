== The Default Use Case (Cooked/Canonical Mode)

Terminal applications interact with the screen via STDIN annd STDOUT/STDERR.
This puts the burden of drawing text to the screen on the terminal program.
In Linux, this means calling ioctl, which in turn means the Operating System does the drawing.{wj}footnote:[
TODO source code example like st's source code or actual reference
]
GUI applications, by contrast, make calls to WinAPI/X windows/Wayland to make a window and to fill said window.{wj}footnote:[TODO]
Or for the latter step, they may make calls to graphics libraries like OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan that manage calls to the Operating System and graphics card.{wj}footnote:[TODO]

STDIN and STDOUT/STDERR are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)[streams] that are essentially abstractions that give programs a one-pass start-to-end interface to communicate with other programs and files.{wj}footnote:[
I believe most Operating Systems and programming languages standardized on this after the C language came out, though I do not have a source for this.
]

In Rust, printing ASCII is fairly easy:

.Rust
[source,rust]
----
println!("Hello world 1");
// Alternatively
use std::io::{stdout, Write};
write!(stdout(), "Hello world 2\n");
----

To do anything more complicated than just dumping data to the terminal (colours, deleting characters, etc.), you have to make use of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code[ANSI escape codes] (dependant what your terminal supports).

.Rust
[source,rust]
-----
let red = "\x1b[31m";   // text colour (not background)
let clear = "\x1b[0m";
write!(stdout(), "{}I am red text{}, and I am not", red, clear);
-----

.POSIX Shellscript
[source,sh]
-----
RED='\033[31m'   # text colour (not background)
CLEAR='\033[0m'  # \033 is octal for 0x1b (base 16) or 27 (base 10)
printf %b "${RED}I am red text${CLEAR}, and I am not"
-----

This default mode (canonical/cooked mode) affects how you receive input from STDIN.
Cooked mode means preprocessing is done on the input, mainly that the abort button `Ctrl-C` works and that input is buffered until `Enter` is pressed.

.Rust
[source,rust]
----
use std::io::{Read, stdin};
let mut s = String::new();
stdin().read_line(&mut s);
----

See the *Canonical and noncanonical mode* section in the https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html[termios manual] or crossterm's documentation on https://docs.rs/crossterm/0.18.2/crossterm/terminal/index.html#raw-mode[raw mode].


== More Modes

*Canonical mode* or *cooked mode*, detailed above, serves the default use case of automating tasks when you just want to prompt the user for filenames, passwords, etc.
By contrast, *non-canonical mode* or *raw mode* serves the cases when you want to process keypress-by-keypress for a more interactive user interface (pretty much any CLI/TUI program).
In fact, there is no way to read keypress-by-keypress via STDIN (as per standard C){wj}footnote:[
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10004895/#answer-10005522[C - Reading from stdin as characters are typed] "If you really want the characters "as they are entered", you cannot use C io. You have to do it the unix way. (or windows way)"
]{wj}footnote:[
TODO find a more authoritative source on how C streams work.
]

*Framebuffer mode*, is in contrast to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode[*text mode*], is a way directly draw pixels on Linux.
Typically Linux distributions start in framebuffer mode to display a logo and then runs https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Getty[getty] and then your terminal (typically bash).
Framebuffer mode is mutually exclusive to the graphical server and usually you do not interact with framebuffer mode when making terminal programs, but it is good to know about.

Terminals have the concept of two buffers called the *main screen* and the *alternative screen*.
I am not sure as to how exactly the underlying mechanics of this work, however switching between the two are typically signaled via a popular, but non-standard escape sequence.{wj}footnote:[

Another option is programs such as https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug[Ã¼berzug] and https://github.com/tats/w3m[w3m]-img works.
I believe they work by drawing over other windows.{wj}footnote:[

== Windows vs Unixes

In Linux most terminals should support ANSI escape codes, which I explain later on.

As of the anniversary update of Windows 10 in 2016, ANSI.sys began being packaged with Win10 supporting ANSI codes.{wj}footnote:[
TODO find better citation.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences[Docs: Console Virtual Terminal Sequences]. Microsoft, 2020. 2018-12-07.
]
On Win10, you will need to a compliant terminal such as bash bundled with the https://git-scm.com/[git], cygwin, Emacs, gvim, etc. to make use of ANSI codes, and thereupon based terminal applications.
For Windows specifically, you must perform a one-liner to enable ANSI mode.{wj}footnote:[
Using the https://github.com/ogham/rust-ansi-term[ansi_term] crate in Rust, you can enable ANSI on Win10 `let enabled = ansi_term::enable_ansi_support();`
]{wj}footnote:[
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences[Docs: Console Virtual Terminal Sequences]. Microsoft, 2020. 2018-12-07.
"The following terminal sequences are intercepted by the console host when written into the output stream, if the ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING flag is set on the screen buffer handle using the SetConsoleMode function."
]{wj}footnote:[
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/setconsolemode
]

== Libraries

I would recommend the following crates for making terminal applications:

* https://github.com/ogham/rust-ansi-term[ansi_term] for a more minimalist resource (supporting the Unixes and Win10 or newer), but you cannot query the dimensions of the terminal. You need to call ioctl for that.{wj}footnote:[
https://github.com/redox-os/termion/blob/11fbe7155681c3c87495a2fa8ee9f822b18e2b2a/src/sys/unix/size.rs#L14-L20[termion/src/sys/unix/size.rs]. GitHub, Inc., 2020. Hash 0x11fbe71556. Line 14 to line 20.
]

* https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm[crossterm] to support down to Win7 and with better IO.
* https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion[termion] if you do not care for Windows.

Widget libraries typically build on top of the above:

* The ncurses framework
* Tuirs

== Clarifying Jargon

Nowadays, the following three terms essentially all refer to the same thing.

A __**terminal**__ use to refer to the physical devices such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100[this].
_Terminals_ where developed for workflow of one terminal per user, which served as the computer's user interface, to economically use computers back when they were expensive (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timesharing[timesharing]).

Now _terminal_ mostly refer consoles/command lines/terminal emulators/etc. whose defining feature the same workflow as the terminals of old: manging input and output as text via STDOUT and STDIN.

A __**terminal emulator**__ is a program like (st, urxvt, xterm) which specifically try to emulate the terminals of olds (i.e. suports VTxxx escape sequences, see https://www.vt100.net/[VT100.net] by Paul Flo Williams)).
Typically, modern terminal emulators support the VT100 series.{wj}footnote:[
Williams, Paul Flo. https://www.vt100.net/[VT100.net]. 2020. "VT100 Series. Probably the most famous terminal name in the world, and the most emulated"
]{wj}footnote:[
https://st.suckless.org/[st - simple terminal]. suckless.org, 2020. "most VT10X escape sequences" and "Ideally, there would be a general tty widget and then vt102..."
]{wj}footnote:[
https://linux.die.net/man/1/urxvt[urxvt(1) - Linux man page]. die.net. "a VT102 emulator for the X window system"
]
However, programs like https://github.com/nushell/nushell[Nushell], [PowerShell], and http://en.wikibedia.ru/wiki/Command_prompt_(Windows)[Cmd] are _not_ terminal _emulators_ because they do not emulate the VTxxx instruction sets, but I would still call them _terminals_.

I believe the term __**console**__ comes from the panels used to control machines.{wj}footnote:[
I am probably never going to put in the research to verify the etymology for _consoles_. See definition one of https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/console2[console] in the Oxford dictionary.
]
For software, for this narrow sense, I think of game consoles (a drop down windows/menu primarily to allow the developer access to convenience functions, e.g. teleporting to a level).
_Console_ in a broader sense is used as a synonym for a terminal, as a terminal is the interface through which you use your computer.


As far as I can tell, there is no difference between *CLI* (Command Line Interface) and *TUI* (Terminal User Interface).

The __**shell**__ is the default program that runs inside a terminal that expects the terminal to be an output.
A __shell__ is just a REPL environment for a programming language (usually each shell implements its own flavour of programming language).
Typically the shellscripts are designed for the domain of primarily using external (i.e. other people's programs).
And in fact, people do use python, ruby, perl, etc. as their shell though it tends to be more unwiedly for this use case.
Compare:

.Rust
[source,rust]
----
std::process::Command("sed").args(&["s/i/t/g", "foo.txt"], ).output().unwrap()
----

.POSIX shellscript
[source,sh]
----
sed 's/i/t/g' foo.txt
----
